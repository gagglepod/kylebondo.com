Hi, I'm <strong>Kyle</strong>. I'm a UX Designer, Software Engineer and
Podcaster based in Fort Worth, Texas.

This site is my portfolio, catalog of ideas, and experiments that drive me. I'm known best for making podcasts (Merchants of Dirt, <a href="https://waryankee.com" target="_blank">War Yankee</a>, <a href="https://pausefordramaticeffect.com" target="_blank">PAUSE for Dramatic Effect</a>), teaching new podcasters how to get into podcasting (Podwrecked, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gagglepod3628" target="_blank">Gagglepod</a>), and creating <a href="https://oncetold.us" target="_blank">Oncetold</a>, the podcasting host for new podcasters.

I love user experience design, wicked design thinking, low-fidelity wireframing, podcasting, emerging technology, and leading teams excited in making a small dent in the universe. My problem-solving skills were honed from years of chaos management in the US Navy and parenting - both surprisingly similar. You can see some of my work on <a href="https://github.com/gagglepod" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

I've been podcasting for over 7 years now and have been working on
processes and software that simplify the complicated world of podcasting.
This inspired me to develop my first podcasting media platform called <em><a href="https://oncetold.us" target="_blank">Oncetold</a></em>, a simplified toolkit for building podcasts.

Before <a href="https://oncetold.us" target="_blank">Oncetold</a> was <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gagglepod3628" target="_blank">Gagglepod</a></em>, a podcast design studio I co-founded with <a href="https://createartpodcast.com" target="_blank">Timothy Kimo Brien</a>. Through Gagglepod we held hundreds of meetups and virtual coaching seminars that taught new podcasters how to create shows, use audio
technology, and build good podcasts. Out of Gagglepod, Tim and I started <em>Podwrecked</em>, a podcast to help podcasters survive their podcast, and helped me
become a featured speaker at several conferences including <a href="https://podfestexpo.com/" target="_blank">Podfest Expo</a>, <a href="https://podfestglobal.online/" target="_blank">Podcast Global</a>, Independent Podcast Conference (ICON), <a href="https://www.indiepodcon.com/" target="_blank">Mid-Atlantic Podcast Conference (MAPCON)</a>, <a href="https://galaxycon.com/pages/richmond" target="_blank">GalaxyCon</a> and several <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamps</a>. View several of my most recent talks on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gagglepod3628" target="_blank">Gagglepod YouTube Channel</a>.

Once upon a time, I took on the <a href="https://www.napodpomo.org" target="_blank">NaPodPoMo</a> challenge to make an Audio Drama. The end
result was <a href="https://pausefordramaticeffect.com" target="_blank">PAUSE for Dramatic Effect</a>, a 17-episode serial podcast that let me have fun with writing,
directing, producing, and even voice acting.

I am a big American Civil War enthusiast and created <a href="https://waryankee.com" target="_blank">War Yankee</a>, a history podcast that explores the <em>Overland Campaign</em> of 1864, as a way to explore the battlefields that surrounded my home in Fredericksburg,
Virginia.

Finally, I've founded a few small businesses in my day. One of these companies was Reckoneer. I built Reckoneer from a blog into an outdoor racing company, that taught new race directors the business of endurance racing, race promotion and event production. It was through Reckoneer that I started podcasting with the creation of my highly successful podcast <em>Merchants of Dirt</em>.
