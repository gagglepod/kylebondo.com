## Poddown (n) (POD-down)

_Play pronunciation audio_

1. When you have a podcast nobody can find.
2. An RSS file that is invalid or contains a formatting error.
3. A directory not updating your podcast when a new episode comes out.

### Insight

You need to know when your podcast is suffering a poddown.
Always subscribe to your podcast with multiple players (e.g.
Google Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, Radiopublic) and then check in on your podcast every time you release a new episode.\n\nBe patient. Not all players are created equal and some take longer than others to recognize you added a new episode to your RSS feed. However, 48 hours is too long and could mean something else is wrong with your feed.\n\nThe trick is to know which directories are updating and which are not. Then, via a process of elimination, you can troubleshoot the reasons your new episodes are not showing up where you expect them to.

### Examples

<em>"My podcast hasn't updated on Apple Podcasts in a week. I think I have a poddown"</em>
<em>"The feed failed to update and left me with a poddown."</em>
