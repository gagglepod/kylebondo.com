The best part of UX design is paper wireframing. It forces you to think about how real people will use it. Up until that wireframe becomes an actual prototype, it could be anything - it could even be a boat.

This is the part where I get to see how UX design can be applied to everything we humans do, use, and enjoy! This is probably why I'm into a lot of different things -- G.I. Joe, public speaking, application development, audio drama direction, rucking, podcasting, coffee, cloud computing, mountain bike racing -- it's a crazy list. But it's a list that keeps me curious, always learning, and finding new opportunities to be part of the process.

UX has always been my JAM. I truly love all that squishy ideation stuff that has to happen before you get to Version 1.0. In the past, I never knew I was doing UX at the time I was doing it. Now, UX is where I live -- looking back at you from that place between finding your WHY and finding your WHAT!

Do you see me there?
Howdy!
